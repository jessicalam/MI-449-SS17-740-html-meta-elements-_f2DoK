    <h1>The Pokemon T-Shirt</h1>
    <h2>About the Pokeball Shirt</h2>
    <p>We never see a Pokémon Trainer with a bad arm. Some of these Pokémon aren't that big, people. The pinpoint accuracy these ten year olds have is ridiculous. Are you just going to walk within five feet of a Pidgey that could potentially try and dive bomb you? Absolutely not! You stay at a safe distance and you launch that Poké Ball. We wonder if the backup plan is being a pitcher in baseball if being a Pokémon Trainer doesn't pan out. These kids are throwing bullets!</p>
    <p>The Pokémon Poké Ball Tee features the iconic ball on a black shirt. A gold silhouette of the ball with a gold top and black bottom with "Pokémon" written beneath. 100% cotton. Machine wash cold. Tumble low dry. Imported.</p>
